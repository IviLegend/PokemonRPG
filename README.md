This project is a very small Pokemon fangame I'm making from scratch to learn some Java systems.

All the sprites used for the game are from
- https://pokemondb.net/sprites.
- https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/bw-sprites.404671/
- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_game_characters
- https://dex.pokemonshowdown.com/pokemon

Features:
- The sprites for the pok√©mons are all from Gen V.
- The combat system is from Gen V.
- The types are adapted for Gen VI, therefore including Fairy type.
- The sprites for the icons are all from Gen VI.
- Megaevolutions.
